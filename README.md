## What is a growth mindset?
#### A growth mindset believes that one’s fundamental abilities can be developed through perseverance and effort; intelligence and talent are simply good starting points. A growth mindset is synonymous with a love of learning.

## if we talk about growth mind set it's mean pathways to more creativity and possibility, and enable the setting of higher goals and more achievement.
## Here’s a simple illustration highlighting the differences between a fixed and a growth mindset:

### Perseverance, gumption traps, and maintaining a growth mindset :
#### Here is an example about chalnges we faced it :
##### when I wasn’t in the right mindset: learning Java. I studied a bit of Java at university, and have worked with it in almost every role I’ve had (including my current gig as a developer on Jira Software), and yet I still find it hard to get my head around. I have a tendency to work over one particular aspect of it again and again until I conclude that it’s impossible or that I’m incapable of solving it. So, lately, I try to recognize that avoidance, take a step back, and think about the growth mindset. When I’m ready, I walk through the problem once again, bit by bit, looking for new ways to think about it until I start to see another way forward. And for me, it always helps to talk through these steps – out loud, not just in my head. I jot down clues as they come about. Soon enough (and rather miraculously), I begin to find root causes of the problem.
## Obstacles:
#### My first impulse when I hit a roadblock is to immediately divert my attention to something else. I lose focus, just like it says in the chart above. Whether it’s clicking a tempting bookmark in my browser, nipping out to grab a coffee, or just about anything to delay keeping at it and fighting through the discomfort. A coworker calls this “instant gratification monkey syndrome.” It’s the idea that we’ll do just about anything other than the actual task at hand if it has suddenly become challenging, and especially when there are so many tempting diversions – articles, videos, email, social – mere clicks away.
## Effort :
### I have similar troubles with cycling. When my alarm goes off at 5 A.M., the thought of going out on the bike is dreadful. The temptation to stay in bed is strong, strong, strong – curse you, instant gratification monkey – but I also know the feeling won’t last and I’ll feel guilty later, as always. The trite-but-true phrase “no pain, no gain” is pure growth mindset!
## Criticism :
##### I also find it useful to review each of my days and assess how I’ve done. As I mentioned at the beginning, I often judge my days based on my mood at the end. My worst days are when I haven’t managed to get things together, I’ve procrastinated and wasted time, and I find myself with very little to look back on positively.


##### **What was the best part of the day?**
##### **What went wrong, and how can I make sure it doesn’t happen again?**
##### These **questions** help me focus on all aspects of my day, the good and the bad, and they help me internalize strategies for creating more good days going forward.

##### And it turns out, variations of these questions help me process criticism from coworkers. Assuming their critique is valid (and it usually is), I can hold a mini-retrospective with myself:

##### Which aspects of my work am I most proud of?
##### What can I do to improve the aspects I’m less proud of?
##### That’s the dark side of growth, I guess…
