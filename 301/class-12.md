| Definition       | SQL databases are primarily called RDBMS or Relational Databases | NoSQL databases are primarily called as Non-relational or distributed database |
| Ability to scale | SQL databases are vertically scalable                            | NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable                                      |

# nosql vs sql
### What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
SQL databases are not best fit for hierarchical data storage
### Give a real world example.
Order management system database
### What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data
### Give a real world example.
LinkedIn
### Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
NoSQL
### Which type of database is best for scalability?
NoSQL

# sql vs nosql 
### What does SQL stand for?
Structured Query Language
### What is a realational database?
A relational database is a digital database based on the relational model of data.
### What type of structure does a relational database work with?
Relational Model. 
### What is a ‘schema’?
The database schema is its structure described in a formal language supported by the database management system. The term "schema" refers to the organization of data as a blueprint of how the database is constructed.
### What is a NoSQL database?
A NoSQL database provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases.
### How does it work?
 NoSQL is an approach to databases that represents a shift away from traditional relational database management systems (RDBMS). To define NoSQL, Relational databases rely on tables, columns, rows, or schemas to organize and retrieve data. In contrast, NoSQL databases do not rely on these structures and use more flexible data models
### What is inside of a Mongo database?
MongoDB stores data records as documents (specifically BSON documents) which are gathered together in collections.
### Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.
Data in MongoDB has a flexible schema. Collections do not enforce document structure by default. This flexibility gives you data-modeling choices to match your application and its performance requirements.
### What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
1. NoSQL databases don’t have the reliability functions which Relational Databases have
2. NoSQL is not compatible (at all) with SQL.
3. NoSQL are very new compared to Relational Databases, which means that are far less stable and may have a lot less functionalities.
