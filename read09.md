## Choosing A Text Editor
##### When I first started out learning about web development, one of the things that I felt compelled to do was to download a text editor. I figured that I was going to be writing a good deal of code, and a good text editor should help me do that.
##### However, as I was scouring YouTube for how-to-code videos, it seemed that each instructional video I watched, the instructor alway seemed to use a different text editor. Being curious about why one text editor was favored over another, I would download each text editor just to be able to compare. I can’t say that I’ve found an absolute favorite yet. But choosing a text edito ends up being a very personal choice, as personal as the sports team you support. I don’t think that it truly matters as to which text editor you use. Yes some text editing software comes with features that other text editin software does not. But for the most part, they’re all pretty similar.
## What is a text editor?
#### A text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write to build a web site. The text editor has to be one of the most important tools you can use as an aspiring web developer.
#### What features should you look for in a text editor? I would say someof the most important features are: 1.) code completion; 2.) syntaxhighlighting; 3.) a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and fatigue); and 4.) the ability to choose from a healthy selection ofextensions available when you need them. You might find some otherfeatures that are must-have’s, but I think these features are a goodstart.A great feature of any text editing software is code completion. Code completion allows you to start typing, and the code completion feature will display possible suggestions based on what you originally typed. This saves you time by providing a choice, rather than allowing you to finish typing and possibly encounter typos.
## The Difference Between Text Editors and IDEs
#### A text edito It also man wrangler” because in a way that’s what really a text editor does. It wrangles your text together into something meaningful. An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is really a suite of different software all coming together. An IDE is a text editor, a file manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one software package. You can think about an IDE very much like Microsoft Outlook. If you’ve ever used Microsoft Outlook, you would have quickly noticed that it was an email client, a calendar, a task manager, a to-do list all in one software package. Similar to how an IDE is an all-in-one software package. While you might not be ready, or have the need to use a compiler, or a debugger when you’re just starting out in web development, you’ll get to see how an IDE operates in your text editing software. When you’re ready to use an IDE, you’ll be more confident in how to use it because you’ll already had some experience with it by using your text editor. Me? I’ll stick with the text-editors I’ve mentioned above. I’ve been using them all on and off for a while, but I can’t seem to make up my mind which one I want forever and ever. What happens to me is that I’ll stick with one text editor for a while, only to find out that the others have all been updated so radically that they have new and xciting features. So, I’ll start using that updated text editor for a while, and in the meanwhile, the others will be updated. So, I’ll start using those ones. It’s a viscous cycle. t would be so interesting to hear what some of you are using for your text editor. Please share and let us know which text editor is your favorite and why. Let’s make this a nice robust list of our favorite text editors for all of us who are new to web development.
## The Command Line!
## Introduction
#### Linux has a graphical user interface and it works pretty much like the GUI's on other systems that you are familiar with such as Windows and OSX. This tutorial won't focus on these as I reckon you can probably figure that part out by yourself. This tutorial will focus instead on the command line (also known as a terminal) running Bash.

#### The command line is an interesting beast, and if you've not used one before, can be a bit daunting. Don't worry, with a bit of practice you'll soon come to see it as your friend. Don't think of it as leaving the GUI behind so much as adding to it. While you can leave the GUI alltogether, most people open up a command line interface just as another window on their desktop (in fact you can have as many open as you like). This is also to our advantage as we can have several command lines open and doing different tasks in each at the same time. We can also easily jump back to the GUI when it suits us. Experiment until you find the setup that suits you best. As an example I will typically have 3 terminals open: 1 in which I do my working, another to bring up ancilliary data and a final one for viewing Manual pages (more on these later).
## So where are we?
#### The first command we are going to learn is pwd which stands for Print Working Directory. (You'll find that a lot of commands in linux are named as an abbreviation of a word or words describing them. This makes it easier to remember them.) The command does just that. It tells you what your current or present working directory is. Give it a try now.
## More About Files!
### Introduction
##### After the previous section I'm sure you're keen and eager to get stuck into some more commands and start doing some actual playing about with the system. We will get to that shortly but first we need to cover some theory so that when we do start playing with the system you can fully understand why it is behaving the way it is and how you can take the commands you learn even further. That is what this section and the next intend to do. After that it will start getting interesting, I promise.
### Everything is a File Ok, the first thing we need to appreciate with linux is that under the hood, everything is actually a file. A text file is a file, a directory is a file, your keyboard is a file (one that the system reads from only), your monitor is a file (one that the system writes to only) etc. To begin with, this won't affect what we do too much but keep it in mind as it helps with understanding the behaviour of Linux as we manage files and directories.

#### Linux is an Extensionless System
##### This one can sometimes be hard to get your head around but as you work through the sections it will start to make more sense. A file extension is normally a set of 2 - 4 characters after a full stop at the end of a file, which denotes what type of file it is. The following are common extensions:

- file.exe - an executable file, or program.
- file.txt - a plain text file.
- file.png, file.gif, file.jpg - an image.
