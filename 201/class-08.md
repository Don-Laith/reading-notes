## Layout
### Controlling the position of elements
### Creating site layouts
### Designing for different sized screens
##### In this chapter we are going to look at how to control where each element sits on a page and how to create attractive page layouts. This involves learning about how designing for a screen can be different to designing for other mediums (such as print). In this chapter we will:
## Building Blocks
#### CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box. Block-level boxes start on a new line and act as the main building blocks of any layout, while inline boxes flow between surrounding text. You can control how much space each box takes up by setting the width of the boxes (and sometimes the height, too). To separate boxes, you can use borders, margins, padding, and background colors.
## containing Elements
#### If one block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box is known as the containing or parent element. It is common to group a number of elements together inside a <div> (or other block-level) element. For example, you might group together all of the elements that form the header of a site (such as the logo and the main navigation). The <div> element that contains this group of elements is then referred to as the containing element.
#### The orange lines in this diagram represent <div> elements. The header (containing the logo and navigation) are in one <div> element, the main content of the page is in another, and the footer is in a third. The <body> element is the containing element for these three <div> elements. The second <div> element is the containing element for two paragraphs of Latin text and images (represented by crossed squares).

Lorem Ipsum CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to control the layout of a page: normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute positioning. You specify the positioning scheme using the position property in CSS. You can also float elements using the float property. normal flow Every block-level element appears on a new line, causing each item to appear lower down the page than the previous one. Even if you specify the width of the boxes and there is space for two elements to sit side-byside, they will not appear next to each other. This is the default behavior (unless you tell the browser to do something else). relative Positioning This moves an element from the position it would be in normal flow, shifting it to the top, right, bottom, or left of where it would have been placed. This does not affect the position of surrounding elements; they stay in the position they would be in in normal flow. aBsolute Positioning This positions the element in relation to its containing element. It is taken out of normal flow, meaning that it does not affect the position of any surrounding elements (as they simply ignore the space it would have taken up). Absolutely positioned elements move as users scroll up and down the page. The paragraphs appear one after the other, vertically down the page. The second paragraph has been pushed down and right from where it would otherwise have been in normal flow. The heading is positioned to the top right, and the paragraphs start at the top of the screen (as if the heading were not there). See page 365 See page 366 See page 367
#### To indicate where a box should be positioned, you may also need to use box offset properties to tell the browser how far from the top or bottom and left or right it should be placed. (You will meet these when we introduce the positioning schemes on the following pages.)
### fixed Positioning
#### This is a form of absolute positioning that positions the element in relation to the browser window, as opposed to the containing element. Elements with fixed positioning do not affect the position of surrounding elements and they do not move when the user scrolls up or down the page.
## floating elements
#### In normal flow, each block-le element sits on top of the ne one. Since this is the default way in which browsers treat HTML elements, you do not need a CSS property to indic that elements should appear in normal flow, but the synta would be: position: static; I have not specified a width property for the heading element, so you can see how stretches the width of the en browser window by default. The paragraphs are restricted to 450 pixels wide. This show how the elements in normal start on a new line even if the do not take up the full width the browser window. All of the examples that demonstrate positioning will a similar HTML structure.
