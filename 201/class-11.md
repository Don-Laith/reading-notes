## IMAGE 
#### Controlling the size and alignment of your images using CSS keeps rules that affect the presentation of your page in the CSS and out of the HTML markup.
#### You can also achieve several interesting effects using background images. In this chapter you will learn how to: ● Specify the size and alignment of an image using ● Add background images to boxes ● Create image rollovers in CSS
## controllIng sIzes of Images In css
### You can control the size of an image using the width and height properties in CSS, just like you can for any other box. Specifying image sizes helps pages to load more smoothly because the HTML and CSS code will often load before the images, and telling the browser how much space to leave for an image allows it to render the rest of the page without waiting for the image to download.
#### You might think that your site is likely to have images of all different sizes, but a lot of sites use the same sized image across many of their pages. For example, an e-commerce site tends to show product photos at the same size. Or, if your site is designed on a grid, then you might have a selection of image sizes that are commonly used on all pages, such as: Small portrait: 220 x 360 Small landscape: 330 x 210 Feature photo: 620 x 400 Whenever you use consistently sized images across a site,
## artIcl lIgnIng Images
#### In the last chapter, you saw how the float property can be used to move an element to the left or the right of its containing block, allowing text to flow around it. Rather than using the <img> element's align attribute, web page authors are increasingly using the float property to align images. There are two ways that this is commonly achieved: 1: The float property is added to the class that was created to represent the size of the image (such as the small class in our example).
#### By default, images are inline elements. This means that they flow within the surrounding text. In order to center an image, it should be turned into a blocklevel element using the display property with a value of block. Once it has been made into a block-level element, there are two common ways in which you can horizontally center an image: 1: On the containing element, you can use the text-align property with a value of center. 2: On the image itself, you can use the use the margin property and set the values of the left a
## BackgroUnd Images
### The background-image property allows you to place an image behind any HTML element. This could be the entire page or just part of the page. By default, a background image will repeat to fill the entire box. The path to the image follows the letters url, and it is put inside parentheses and quotes.
## Practical information
### To wrap up the book we are going to look at some practical information that will help you launch a successful site.
### There are entire books written about each of the topics covered in this chapter but I will introduce you to the key themes that each subject deals with and give you pointers for what you need to be considering. You will see:

### SEO is a huge topic and several books have been written on the subject. The following pages will help you understand the key concepts so you can improve your website's visibility on search engines.
## the Basics
### Search engine optimization (or SEO) is the practice of trying to help your site appear nearer the top of search engine results when people look for the topics that your website covers. At the heart of SEO is the idea of working out which terms people are likely to enter into a search engine to find your site and then using these terms in the right places on your site to increase the chances that search engines will show a link to your site in their results. In order to determine who comes first in the search results, search engines do not only look at what appears on your site. They also consider how many sites link to you (and how relevant those links are). For this reason, SEO is often split into two areas: on-page techniques and off-page techniques.
## on-Page techniques
### On-page techniques are the methods you can use on your web pages to improve their rating in search engines. The main component of this is looking at keywords that people are likely to enter into a search engine if they wanted to find your site, and then including these in the text and HTML code for your site in order to help the search engines know that your site covers these topics. Search engines rely very heavily on the text that is in your pages so it is important that the terms people are going to search for are in text. There are seven essential places where you want your keywords to appear. Ensuring that any images have appropriate text in the value of their alt attribute also helps search engines understand the content of images.
## off-Page techniques
### Getting other sites to link to you is just as important as on-page techniques. Search engines help determine how to rank your site by looking at the number of other sites that link to yours. They are particularly interested in sites whose content is related to yours. For example, if you were running a website that sold fish bait, then a link from a hairdresser is not likely to be considered as relevant as one from an angling community. Search engines also look at the words between the opening <a> tag and closing </a> tag in the link. If the text in the link contains keywords (rather than just click here or your website address) it may be considered more relevant. The words that appear in links to your site should also appear in the text of the page that the site links to.
## on-Page seo
### 1: Page title The page title appears at the top of the browser window or on the tab of a browser. It is specified in the <title> element which lives inside the <head> element. 2: url / WeB address The name of the file is part of the URL. Where possible, use keywords in the file name. 3: headings If the keywords are in a heading <hn> element then a search engine will know that this page is all about that subject and give it greater weight than other text. 4: text Where possible, it helps to repeat the keywords in the main body of the text at least 2-3 times. Do not, however, over-use these terms, because the text must be easy for a human to read. 5: link text Use keywords in the text that create links between pages (rather than using generic expressions such as "click here"). 6: image alt text Search engines rely on you providing accurate descriptions of images in the alt text. This will also help your images show up in the results of image-based searches. 7: Page descriPtions The description also lives inside the <head> element and is specified using a <meta> tag. It should be a sentence that describes the content of the page. (These are not shown in the browser window but they may be displayed in the results pages of search engines.) Never try to fool search engines! They will penalize you for it. For example, never add text in the same color as the background of the page as they can detect this. 6 1 4 5 2 3
