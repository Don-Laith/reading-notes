## Images 
###There are many reasons why you might want to add an image to a web page: you might want to include a logo, photograph, illustration, diagram, or chart. There are several things to consider when selecting and preparing images for your site, but taking time to get them right will make it look more attractive and professional. In this chapter you will learn how to:
#### 
● Include an image in your web pages using HTML
● Pick which image format to use
● Show an image at the right size
● Optimize an image for use on the web to make pages
#### ChoosIng Images for Your sIte
#### Images can be used to set the tone for a site in less time than it takes to read a description. If you do not have photographs to use on your website, there are companies who sell stock images; these are images you pay to use (there is a list of stock photography websites below). Remember that all images are subject to copyright, and you can get in trouble for simply taking photographs from another website. If you have a page that shows several images (such as product photographs or members of a team) then putting them on a simple, consistent background helps them look better as a group. A picture can say a thousand words, and great images help make the difference between an average-looking site and a really engaging one.
#### As a website grows, keeping images in a separate folder helps you understand how the site is organized. Here you can see an example of the files for a website; all of the images are stored in a folder called images. On a big site you might like to add subfolders inside the images folder. For example, images such as logos and buttons might sit in a folder called interface, product photographs might sit in a page called products, and images related to news might live in a folder called news. If you are using a content management system or blogging platform, there are usually tools built into the admin site that allow you to upload images, and the program will probably already have a separate folder for image files and any other uploads.
## adding image 
#### To add an image into the page you need to use an <img> element. This is an empty element (which means there is no closing tag). It must carry the following two attributes: src This tells the browser where it can find the image file. This will usually be a relative URL pointing to an image on your own site. (Here you can see that the images are in a child folder called images — relative URLs were covered on pages 83-84). alt This provides a text description of the image which describes the image if you cannot see it. title You can also use the title attribute with the <img> element to provide additional information about the image. Most browsers will display the content of this

In this chapter we will look at: ● How to specify colors, as there are three common ways in which you can indicate your choice of colors (plus extra ways made available in CSS3) ● Color terminology, as there are some terms that are very helpful to understand when it comes to picking colors ● Contrast, and ensuring that your text is readable ● Background colors for behind either your entire page or parts of a page What you will learn about colors in this chapter will then be used in subsequent chapters when it comes to looking at colors of text and boxes in CSS.carry the following two attributes: src This tells the browser where it can find the image file.

#### The color property allows you to specify the color of text inside an element. You can specify any color in CSS in one of three ways: rgb values These express colors in terms of how much red, green and blue are used to make it up. For example: rgb(100,100,90) hex Codes These are six-digit codes that represent the amount of red, green and blue in a color, preceded by a pound or hash # sign. For example: #ee3e80 Color names There are 147 predefined color names that are recognized by browsers. For example: DarkCyan We look at these three different ways of specifying colors on the next double-page spread. CSS3 has also introduced
### Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red, green, and blue. To find the color you want, you can use a color picker. Computer monitors are made up of thousands of tiny squares called pixels (if you look very closely at your monitor you should be able to see them). When the screen is not turned on, it's black because it's not emitting any light. When it's on, each pixel can be a different color, creating a picture. The color of every pixel on the screen is expressed in terms of a mix of red, green, and blue — just like on a television screen.
## choosing a type face for your WEBSITE
#### When choosing a typeface, it is important to understand that a browser will usually only display it if it's installed on that user's computer. Serif Serif fonts have extra details on the end of the main strokes of the letters. exampleS: Georgia Times Times New Roman SanS-Serif Sans-serif fonts have straight ends to letters and therefore have a much cleaner design. exampleS: Arial Verdana Helvetica As a result, sites often use a small set of typefaces that are installed on most computers (shown above). There are some techniques to get around this limitation (which are covered on pages 271-272). It is possible to specify more than one typeface and create an order of preference (in case the user does not have your first choice of typeface
