## Introductory HTML and JavaScript
## Structure
#### Many web pages act like electronic versions of these documents. For example, newspapers show the same stories in print as they do on websites; you can apply for insurance over the web; and stores have online catalogs and e-commerce facilities
#### HTML Uses El ementsto Describe the Structure of Pages
##### Let's look closer at the code from the last page. There are several different elements. Each element has an opening tag and a closing tag.
#### Tags act like containers. They tell you something about the information that lies between their opening and closing tags.
#### Attributes Tell Us More About El ements
##### Attributes provide additional information about the contents of an element. They appear on the opening tag of the element and are made up of two parts: a name and a value, separated by an equals sign.
## Summary STRUCTURE
- ages are text documents.
- HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled brackets) to give the information they surround special meaning.
- Tags are often referred to as elements.
- Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes the end.
- Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more about the content of that element.
- Attributes require a name and a value.
- To learn HTML you need to know what tags are available for you to use, what they do, and where they.
## Extra Markup
### Escape Characters:
#### Therefore, if you want these
###characters to appear on your
###page you need to use what are termed "escape" characters (also known as escape codes or entity references). For example,to write a left angled bracket,you can use either or  For an ampersand, youcan use either8;.There are also special codesthat can be used to showsymbols such as copyright andtrademark, currency symbols,mathematical characters, andsome punctuation marks. Forexample, if you want to include acopyright symbol on a web page you can use either  
#### When using escape characters,
##### it is important to check the page in your browser to ensurethat the correct symbol showsup. This is because some fonts do not support all of these characters and you might therefore need to specify  different font for these characters in your CSS code. There are some characters that are used in and reserved by HTML code. (For example, the left and right angled brackets.)
## HTML5 LayouT
#### HTML5 is introducing a new set ofelements that help define the structure ofThey are covered here (rather than with the other HTMLelements you met earlier in the book) because you'll findit easier to understand how they can be used now that youhave seen how CSS can control the layout a page. Thesenew elements are going to play an important part in creatinglayouts going forward. 
#### In this chapter you will see:
● The new HTML5 layout elements and their uses
● How they offer helpful alternatives to the <div> element
● How to ensure older browsers recognize these elements
#### As with all HTML5 and CSS3 content, its usage is stillsubject to change but it is already widely being used by webdevelopers and it is likely that you will want to use them.
## summary
#### HTML5 LayouThe new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose ofifferent parts of a web page and help to describes structure.he new elements provide clearer code (comparedith using multiple <div> elements).Older browsers that do not understand HTML5ements need to be told which elements arelock-level elements.o make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed,hich is available free from Google.
