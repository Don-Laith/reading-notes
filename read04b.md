## The summary for video
### how commputer works 
#### you gonna learn how realy work that make the computer a computer  
### how computer use curcuit to work and look to the different part of the computer actuualy input and output  and store all of the information
### finaly you will know  how software controll hardware 



### How computer works:
### Computeres are every where maybe in your back back for right no , what does make the computer a computer 

### As humman we always bulid tools to solve a proplem to print fast or some thing like that all of that is working manually 
### people wonder  if the machine design to bulit to us of thinking or the thinking what we do 
### these machine is designed to make our life easily  
## it need : 
- input
- store information
- process 
- output
## all compputers have the same 
# the early computer madde from wood and metal 
#### in 20 centry they start to use electric commponant  it was takes hours to make a process  computer with basic caalculation 
#### but now we can use them to talk to each others and play games 
#### first we talk about input 
##### the stuff the words that make your computers do stuff 
# example 
- mouse
- keyboard 
- mike ....etc 
- toch screen 
## storage  :
#####  all these differnet input give information it stored in memory
#### computer proccessore takes information from memory  minculate it using algorithem which is a series of commands 
####this process will continue until the process inf is ready to output
### output 
#### a cmputer display can show picture or videi or games 
#### the output maaay even cintauine single to control robot 
#### computers we are using today are differnet from the old one 
##  and who know what will be the computers tomorow
## all computers do the four  process
### computers work on ones & zeroes
####  no one today does what we do with ones and zeroes
#### inside computers wires & circuits that carry all the information in a computer 

#### how do we store a repreent information using electricity
##### if you have a single wire with electricity  floe in it  the single will be on or off not a lot of choices but what if it was million single
