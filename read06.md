## Introduction
####  Learning to program with JavaScript involves: 
- Understanding some basic programming concepts and the terms that JavaScript programmers use to describe them.
- Learning the language itself and, like all languages, you need to know its vocabulary and how to structure your sentences.
- Becoming familiar with how it is applied by looking at examples of how JavaScript is commonly used in websites today.

##### which allows it to access or change the content of a page. For example:
- A gallery script could check which
image a user clicked on and disA gallery script could check which image a user clicked on and display a larger version of that image
- A mortgage calculator could collect values from a form, perform a ca lculation, and display repayments 
- An animation could check the dimensions of the browser window and move an image to the bottom of the viewable area (also known as the viewport).
• A button is pressed
• A link is clicked (or tapped) on
• A cursor hovers over an element
• Information is added to a form
• An interval of time has passed
• A web page has finished loading

### html and css : a quick refresher :
####  HTML ELEMENTS 
- HTML elements are added to the content of a page to describe its structure. An element consists of the opening and closing tags, plus its content. 
- Tags usually come in pairs with an opening tag and a closing tag. There are a few empty elements with no     content,  They have one self-closing tag. 
- opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more about that element. Attributes have a name and a value. The value is usually given in quotes. 
#### CSS RULES 
- CSS uses rules to indicate how the contents of one or more elements should be displayed in the browser. Each rule has a selector and a declaration block.
- The CSS selector indicates which element(s) the rule applies to. The declaration block contains rules that indicate how those elements should appear. 
- Each declaration in the declaration block has a property (the aspect you want to control), and a value, which is the setting for that property.

## A :
- A SCRIPT IS A SERIES OF INSTRUCTIONS
#### WRITING A SCRIPT
###### To write a script, you need to first state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it. Humans can achieve complex goals without thinking about them too much, for example you might be able to drive a car, cook breakfast, or send an email without a set of detailed instructions. But the first time we do these things they can seem daunting. Therefore, when learning a new skill, we often break it down into smaller tasks, and learn one of these at a time. With experience these individual tasks grow familiar and seem simpler. Some of the scripts you will be reading or writing when you have finished this book will be quite complicated and might look intimidating at first. However, a script is just a series of short instructions, each of which is performed in order to solve the problem in hand. This is why creating a script is like writing a recipe or manual that allows a computer to solve a puzzle one step at a time. It is worth noting, however, that a computer doesn't learn how to perform tasks like you or I might; it needs to follow instructions every time it performs the task. So a program must give the computer enough detail to perform the task as if every time were its first time.
### step for that :
-  DEFINE THE GOAL
- DESIGN THE SCRIPT
#### DESIGNING A SCRIPT: TASKS 
###### Once you know the goal of your script, you can work out the individual tasks needed to achieve it. This high-level view of the tasks can be represented using a flowchart.
#### Each individual task may be broken down into a sequence of steps. When you are ready to code the script, these steps can then be translated into individual lines of code. 

##### Every step for every task shown in a flowchart needs to be written in a language the computer can understand and follow.
## SUMMARY 
### THE ABC OF PROGRAMMING  
###A: What is a script and how do I create one? 
- A script is a series of instructions that the computer can follow in order to achieve a goal. 
- Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of all the instructions.
- Computers approach tasks in a different way than humans, so your instructions must let the computer solve the task programmatically
-  To approach writing a script, break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete that task (a flowchart can help). 
## FUNCTION
#### WHAT IS A FUNCTION?
* Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).
