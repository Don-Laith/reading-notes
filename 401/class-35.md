### what is Graphs ?
A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges. The nodes are sometimes also referred to as vertices and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph
### what is Main Graph Types ?
* Finite Graphs: A graph is said to be finite if it has finite number of vertices and finite number of edges.
* Infinite Graph: A graph is said to be infinite if it has infinite number of vertices as well as infinite number of edges.
* Trivial Graph: A graph is said to be trivial if a finite graph contains only one vertex and no edge.
* Simple Graph: A simple graph is a graph which does not contains more than one edge between the pair of vertices
* Multi Graph: Any graph which contain some parallel edges but doesnâ€™t contain any self-loop is called multi graph

### What is the time complexity of a Graph ?
The time complexity to go over each adjacent edge of a vertex is, say, O(N) , where N is number of adjacent edges. So, for V numbers of vertices the time complexity becomes O(V*N) = O(E) , where E is the total number of edges in the graph.

### What Graph used for?
* In maps that draw cities/states/regions as vertices and adjacency relations as edges.
* Once we have a graph of a particular concept, they can be easily used for finding shortest paths, project planning, etc.
* In circuit networks where points of connection are drawn as vertices and component wires become the edges of the graph.


### Acyclic vs Cyclic
Acyclic Graph

An acyclic graph is a directed graph without cycles.
A cycle is when a node can be traversed through and potentially end up back at it

A Cyclic graph

is a graph that has cycles.
A cycle is defined as a path of a positive length that starts and ends at the same vertex.
