 # How to Solve Programming Problems:

##  Here’s my process and some tips to tackling a sample problem that hopefully some of you may find helpful in your journey.
<!-- 
## what to do:
1. ***You really want to make sure you take enough time to understand the problem completely before attempting to solve it.***
2. ***Another big mistake is trying to over solve the solution on the first iteration.  Keep it simple, don’t try to get fancy.*** -->

<!-- ## simple set of steps to follow which you can use for any algorithm type programming problem: -->


1. ***Read the problem at least three times (or however many makes you feel comfortable).***

### You can’t solve a problem you don’t understand. There is a difference between the problem and the problem you think you are solving. It’s easy to start reading the first few lines in a problem and assume the rest of it because it’s similar to something you’ve seen in the past. If you are making even a popular game like Hangman, be sure to read through any rules even if you’ve played it before. I once was asked to make a game like Hangman that I realized was “Evil Hangman” only after I read through the instructions (it was a trick!).

## Let’s pretend we are creating a simple function selectEvenNumbers that will take in an array of numbers and return an array evenNumbers of only even numbers. If there are no even numbers, return the empty array evenNumbers.
```
function selectEvenNumbers() {
  // your code here
}

```
### Here are some questions that run through my mind:

1. How can a computer tell what is an even number? Divide that number by 2 and see if its remainder is 0.
2. What am I passing into this function? An array
3. What will that array contain? One or more numbers
4. What are the data types of the elements in the array? Numbers
5. What is the goal of this function? What am I returning at the end of this function? The goal is to take all the even numbers and return them in an array. If there are no even numbers, return an empty array.



## 2. Work through the problem manually with at least three sets of sample data

## Take out a piece of paper and work through the problem manually. Think of at least three sets of sample data you can use. Consider corner and edge cases as well.





## 3.  Simplify and optimize your steps
### Look for patterns and see if there’s anything you can generalize. See if you can reduce any steps or if you are repeating any steps.


1. Create a function selectEvenNumbers
2. Create a new empty array evenNumbers where I store even numbers, if any
3. Go through each element in the array [1, 2]
4. Find the first element
5. Decide if it is even by seeing if it is divisible by 2. If it is even, I add that to evenNumbers
6. Find the next element
7. Repeat step #4
8. Repeat step #5 and #4 until there are no more elements in this array
9. Return the array evenNumbers, regardless of whether it has anything in it
